## Purpose
The primary purposes of this project are for me to practice using Selenium and
to automate job searching.  Once this is functional, I may run it once a day.

## Goals
1. Generate scripts specific to several companies' websites
2. Store listings so they can be easily accessed
3. Use a framework for
  - viewing listings
  - keeping track of listings I'm interested in
  - keeping notes on my application processes
  - changing search terms
